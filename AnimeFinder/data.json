One that complains a lot and the other that doesn't do much in the story that can't even protect themselves from danger. I don't want to sound mean but these 3 girls are just a BURDEN to him if he ends up saving him each and every time like in season 1. Since they have EASILY got captured by a group of bandits and now it's up to the MC to come up with a plan to save them",

                    "message": "Aww this episode was so cute! I give this anime a 7.5/10, I felt like a lot of the scenes were cringe and they gave me second-hand embarrassment. But a lot of the scenes were wholesome and cute. It was pretty boring and took me a while to finish but I was able to complete it. I don't think I'll continue the other seasons for this anime for now. Maybe later considering how many other animes I need to finish. I still enjoyed it, especially watching Aoi and Hiyama moments!",

Even my soul is tired at this point, but his voice never fails to heal me and make me want to keep on living. How did this episode give me exactly what I needed? The deep tones of my favorite seiyuu, the flashing neon lights, the distant sounds of the dangerous city and traffic outside, while safe in the lap of a nice, giving and gentle person, with the aroma of the tobacco calming me down, under a beautiful moonlit sky... it‚Äôs like a dream. Only thing that would have made this better was if the character looked at least 15 years older than he does here. It‚Äôs like someone peered into my heart when they made this. I‚Äôm so very grateful it turned out this well and glad that I waited so long for this exact episode. I hope others can have an open mind and give it a watch before skipping it just because it‚Äôs a man‚Äôs voice. And there‚Äôs a very special quality about this episode. Gives me almost Cowboy Bebop vibes with the quiet desperation I feel in these characters.",

I've watched enough sports from old to new, from OneOuts to KnB to SlamDunk etc etc to know there are many facets of each game which can be explored, hell, I've been basketball shooting gaurd for 14yrs, but it's pure blasphemy if you are telling me that this is all new and fresh story. I'm sorry as much I despise to be super critics like AoT twitterati, this one is a modded rip off. They did not even allow the viewers to bask Haikyuus glory, then went ahead and straight up aired it 1 week later which quite literally deletes the only defense about finding similarities. Had they not released it right after it, maybe it would have felt good to have it all back, but now, oh no. Maybe there are people like yourself, good sire, who don't really care even if story is plagiarised through a gray zone, to legally make it seem fresh which makes you enjoy story even if they are similar with different characters and similar facets most people can't. Even if most people do, atleast I don't. And I again emphasise, there are enough facets in each game to be explored and animated for it to not just feel fresh but actually be F R E S H, and this anime is failing quite well at that atleast till the previous episode, but again not giving up on an anime is what a good viewer should do and that's what I will do. I will keep on watching and see how different it is. Good day to you, good sir.",

This anime could have given that personality to another character besides the setter but we always need that cold and aloof character along with their \"genki\" partner lead, something extremely common in many anime outside of sports.( Naruto with Sasuke and Naruto, Free! with Haru and Makoto, KnB with Kuroko and Kagami, etc etc etc)\nBut at least this genki main dude is no Hinata, he gives me more Asahi vibes in his volleyball skills if anything.",

We don't get to see any of the training and hard work, they just simply show up \"better\" than the last time.\nAlso, I hate to compare 2.43 to Haikyuu, but as the main volleyball anime I think is inevitable, Haikyuu made you care, love and sympathize with pretty much every character, friend or \"foe\", you could see where they were coming from and understand them.\n2.43 seems to want to do the opposite, making you dislike/feel indifferent to pretty much every single character in it",

Sure there are a lot of aspects in which it is similar to haikyuu like Chika's backstory and his attitude which is similar to Kageyama. But overall the drama is great. However, they really rushed the matches. I mean I m not saying to drag a set for like 3 episodes but atleast show the match properly. Also the drama and voice acting might be good, but the animation is average and the character designs are nothing special and a bit unoriginal. For example Chika;s design is basically Tsukishima from Black market. So overall I don't hate the anime, but I don't like it either. So a 7/10 for me.\nAnd imma say it:\n2.43 is MID",

But this anime shows us that there's a middleground. In the whole 22 episode Kiriyama's personality hasn't change. Sure he's had his ups and downs, mood swing and the like - but his core personality hasn't changed. Hes the same odd-one-out kid who's socially awkward and overly self-conscious. However what has changed is his drive and goal. He's learnt that shogi is more than just a game. Its an outlet of likeminded people, and a way to make lasting friendships.",

She at least tried to be nice to the 86 while others just treated them like pigs, even if it didn't make them feel better, she tried everything that she could, like how is a 16 year old girl supposed to go against the whole nation and government to convince them that they are humans. And now she got told off that it was all for nothing. If I was in her place, I would definitely quit right at that moment.",
